# 🧠 Mattex Image Search Tool

A smart desktop tool for **image similarity search**, built with **PyQt5**, **MobileNetV2**, and **CLIP**.

This project offers **two powerful versions** to help artists, designers, and developers manage and search large image collections — whether by visual similarity or natural language.

## 📦 Available Versions

### 🔹 [`v1-MobileNet`](./v1-MobileNet)

Image similarity search based on **visual features** using **MobileNetV2** (CNN):

- Extracts image embeddings with TensorFlow
- Compares images using **cosine similarity**
- Fast and lightweight
- Ideal for 3D artists, interior designers, or texture managers

➡️ [View README for v1 →](./v1-MobileNet/README.md)

### 🔹 [`v2-Clip-Integration`](./v2-Clip-Integration)

Experimental version with **text-based search** via **OpenAI CLIP**:

- All features of v1 included
- Search for images using **text queries**, e.g. `"modern black chair"` or `"sunset over mountain"`
- Combines both **visual** and **textual** search in one interface
